Instruction:
When typing in the things, please follow the order which assumes current flow from left to right!
When typing in voltage, please be careful about the directions:

If your voltage looks like this:
        
         5v
--------|!|!--------
      ------>
         I
Please type in V -5


If your voltage looks like this:
        
         5v
--------!|!|--------
      ------>
         I
Please type in V 5


For any resistance connected, please type in R 5      (if the resistance is 5 ohm)


Here's an complete example:

         5v
:--------!|!|--------:
:               2v   :
:-----3ohm --|!|!----:
:                    : 
:-------2ohm---------:
