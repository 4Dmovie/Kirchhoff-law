Description:
A simple Kirchhoff law solver for physical circuits with batteries and resistors.

**limitation**
Not able to solve complex mixed circuits like the following (difficult to read
the 1ohm input):
---------|:|: ------
|                  |
| 		 **1ohm**                  
| 		   |
--------2ohm--------
|                  |
|		   |
--------|:----------

but is able to solve any circuits with any number of parrallel loops:
---------|:|: ------
|                  |
| 		   |                 
| 		   |
--------2ohm--------
|                  |
|		   |
--------|:----------


Instruction: 
When typing in the things, please follow the order which assumes current flow from left to right! When typing in voltage, please be careful about the directions:

If your voltage looks like this:

     5v

--------|!|!-------- ------> I Please type in V -5

If your voltage looks like this:

     5v

--------!|!|-------- ------> I Please type in V 5

For any resistance connected, please type in R 5 (if the resistance is 5 ohm)

Here's an complete example:

     5v

:--------!|!|--------: : 2v : :-----3ohm --|!|!----: : : :-------2ohm---------:

number of things in loop1: 1 things: V 5 number of things in loop2: 2 things: R 3 V -2 number of things in loop3: 1 things: R 2
